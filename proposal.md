## Software: c_lasso

This package implements a variety of different lasso regression techniques. Lasso regression is separate from other types of regression since it uses the L1 norm of the solution as an additional problem constraint that is supposed to be minimized. One interesting side affect of lasso regression is that it drives majority of the weights to 0, which acts as some form of dimension reduction, since the regression essentially removes the useless or unncessary weights. The primary audience of this package are the people who use regression, namely data scientists and machine learners. The lasso regression can also be modified to act as a classification problem instead of a regression, you only need to change the output values to 0 or 1.
